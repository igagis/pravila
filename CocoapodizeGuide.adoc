= WIP: How to pack a C++ library for cocoapods

. create `xcode` directory in project root
. create `cocoapods` directory in project root
. run `Xcode` and and create a new project
.. as a template for the new project select `ios`/`Static Library`
.. click `Next`
.. as `Product Name` enter the library name **without** `lib` prefix
.. fill `Organization Name` and `Organization Identifier` fields
.. as `Language` select `Objective-C`
.. click `Next`
.. select the newly created `xcode` directory as project location
.. click `Create`
.. remove the dummy source files added by `Xcode`
... in the project files navigator, right-click on the folder containing dummy sources
... click `Delete`
... click `Move To Trash`
.. remove overriding of linker flags to suppress cocoapods warning about `OTHER_LDFLAGS` later
... in the project files navigator, select library name with blue icon
... select `Build Settings`
... in search field enter `other linker flags`
... edit the `Other Linker Flags` settings for both `Release` and `Debug`, set it to $(inherited)
. close the `Xcode`
. copy the `Podfile` template to `xcode` directory and edit it accordingly
. add the whole `xcode` directory to git and possibly make a commit. After that it is safe to go to `xcode` directory and run `pod install`
