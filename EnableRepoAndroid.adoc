= enable repo for android

For distributing binary libraries for Android the link:https://github.com/howardpang/androidNativeBundle[androidNativeBundle] plugin is used. Refer to its documentation to find out how to use it.

In the `build.gradle` right before the `dependencies` section (not iside of it) add the repo URL

  repositories {
      maven {
          url 'https://dl.bintray.com/igagis/android/'
      }
  }

so that it looks something like

  repositories {
      maven {
          url 'https://dl.bintray.com/igagis/android/'
      }
  }
  
  dependencies {
    ...
  }
